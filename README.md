My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) challenges in Kotlin.

This is more or less my first time trying Kotlin so I'm learning as I go along and don't really know what I'm doing. Don't expect perfect beautitiful ideomatic Kotlin in here! :)

I was inspired to try it Kotlin this year partly because of [this initiative from Jetbrains](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/11/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin/)
